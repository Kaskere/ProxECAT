# ProxECAT
Proxy External Controls Association Test

rare-variant genetic region association test to robustly use publicly available data with allele frequencies in case-control analysis.

Notes:
--We have found better results by using fairly stringent internal minor allele frequency filters of 1% or 0.1% in either cases or in controls
--make sure to use cases and controls matched by ancestral population
